EDUCATION

  Aug 2013 - May 2017 (Expected)
    B.A., Physics, University of California, Berkeley


RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

  2016 - Present    ALPHA Collaboration at CERN
    Wrote simulations for trapped antihydrogen atoms in octupole magnetostatic
    antimatter traps. Analyzed resulting chaotic trajectories, specifically the
    coupling between axial and transverse modes of energy. Designed algorithm to
    quantify coupling time for unevenly-spaced time series. Contributed to day-
    to-day experiment operations at CERN.

  2015              Mrsic-Flogel Lab at University of Basel
    Designed LabVIEW data acquisition software enabling real-time data readout
    on a widefield microscope for closed-loop applications. Prototyped touchpad
    interface software to allow a mouse to control its position in virtual
    reality.

  2014 - 2015       Theunissen Lab at UC Berkeley
    Studied spectral-temporal features of timbre of Western musical instruments.
    Implemented decoding algorithm to transform Modulation Power Spectrum (2DFT
    of Gaussian-Windowed Spectrogram) into audio waveform.


PUBLICATIONS -- IN PREPARATION

    Axial-transverse energy coupling times for antihydrogen trajectories in
    magnetostatic traps, Zhong, M. and Fajans, J. To be submitted Dec 2016.


CONFERENCE ACTIVITY

  Characteristic coupling time between axial and transverse energy modes for
    antiÂ­hydrogen in magnetostatic traps, Zhong, M. and Fajans, J., APS Division
    of Plasma Physics, v. 61, no. 18, 2016.


GRANTS, AWARDS AND HONORS

  2016        UC Berkeley Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships L&S Fellow
  2013 - 16   College of Letters & Science Dean's Honors


TEACHING AND MENTORING EXPERIENCE

  UC Berkeley, Undergraduate Student Instructor
    Sp 2016   Physics for Scientists and Engineers - Intro to Mechanics
    Fa 2015   Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory


REVERSE ENGINEERING PROJECTS

  2015 - 2016       Cal1ID Radio Frequency ID (RFID) Reader/Spoofer
    Originally for UC Berkeley Instrumentation Lab course final project, built
    circuit to communicate with Cal1ID cards via RFID. Inferred ID number
    encoding protocol from recorded signal (Manchester encoding; frequency-shift
    keying). Built and installed reader for housemates to unlock front door of
    housing co-operative, and spoofer to open locked campus doors.

  2015              Touchpad Interface Software
    Injected C# code into propriety Windows touchpad GUI application to send
    real-time touchpad data via UDP packets. For 2015 Summer lab internship in
    the Mrsic-Flogel lab.

  2015              i>Clicker
    With a couple of friends, pulled the assembled HEX code from the classroom
    voting i>Clicker devices. Identified the basic structure of the ~2000 lines
    of code, and changed a dozen lines so that clicker would (1) broadcast a
    different ID number for every vote, and (2) send unlimited votes per click
    (around 40 votes per second). Used for prank: tinyurl.com/2626votes and
    tinyurl.com/2626votes2 .
