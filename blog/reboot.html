29 Oct 2017 -- Rebooting the Blog
<div class="indent">
Some two months into moving to Buenos Aires, I finally decided to start blogging again. Or really, blogging for the first time with the intent of writing what I care about for the sake of writing what I care about (as opposed to with the focus of trying to impress some grad school committee towards admitting me). What I ultimately reasoned is that I come across a lot of engaging thoughts that I think are worthwhile of sharing! And I do think it would be worthwhile for me to try to put these thoughts in as clear and concise of words as I can, and publish them online, accessible to anybody with an internet connection.

Without a doubt, I struggle with a mountain of insecurity: worries about what others might think about how I write, the overwhelm of the amount of time writing and proofreading and revising consumes, the fear that some might see this as an attempt of self-promotion to feed my own ego. But at the end of the day, the decision is really a question of whether I would rather:
<div class="indent">
(1) give into these insecurities and convince myself that my time would be better spent doing other things, or

(2) take the time and effort to produce content that is inevitably imperfect and critizable, but know at the very least that I made an honest effort in trying.
</div>
And as valid as my insecurities are, there is something so captivating about the idea of contributing to the nonstop conversation of ideas that has never been more globally accessible (thanks, Internet!). How can I engage in conversation if I don't put myself out there?

A couple days ago, I re-encountered Scott Aaronson's <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=7">blog post</a> explaining his own deliberations about starting his blog:
<div class="indent">
Why did I take so long to start a blog?

... the real answer is that to run a successful blog, I knew I’d have to write about what actually mattered to me — and that included more than just the latest arXiv preprints or bizarre complexity classes. I’d have to state strong opinions, make my worst fears everyone else’s business, probably offend some people, and probably embarrass myself. So before I did that, I wanted to make sure I could at least do it in the best, most eloquent words — words that couldn’t possibly be misunderstood.

So what happened? Did I find those words? As you can see for yourself, I didn’t. What happened is that, after finishing grad school and reaching an advanced age, I started to face my mortality. Before then, I could always justify inaction by telling myself I was still preparing for the rest of my life. But once you’re in the rest of your life, if you’re not actually living it, then what are you doing? It occurred to me that, if you wait for the “perfect opportunity” to start a weblog — or switch to a new research area, or ask someone out, or whatever it is you want to do — then you’re essentially just committing delayed suicide. I’m sorry if that sounds trite and obvious.

Efficiency matters. Time constraints change everything. How could I have forgotten?
</div>
Time constraints really do change everything. I have strong enough reasons to start writing - and, given that my lifespan is truly finite, what better time is there to do so than now!
