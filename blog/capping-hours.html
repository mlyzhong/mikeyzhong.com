Thanks to some insightful conversations with an ex-physicist-turned-biotheorist and a wise Slovenian, I have decided that I am capping the amount of time I spend on schoolwork to only 40 hours a week. More or less 8 hours a day on weekdays, close to nothing on weekends. Is this even possible? ! ? ! ?

Being a Berkeley student (go bears!) is both stressful and busy. There is always so much to work to do. I completely relate with staying up late to meet this or that deadline; I've done so countless times by now. Yet, whenever I work, I find myself distracted all the time, browsing political news or memes for edgy teens on the Facebook every 15 minutes or so. This 40-hour-workweek pact is for my own sanity. Not only do I want to produce good work, I want to do so productively, doing as excellent of a job in as little time as possible. The hope is that being aware of the finiteness of this time, I will get a lot more accomplished -- yet have ample time to kick-it with buddies and get enough sleep.

Let me know what you think! I will keep all of you up to date on this.
